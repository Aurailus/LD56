## Theme

TINY CREATURES

## Idea

Sokoban-type game where you control a Poodle Moth trying to get to the other side of a board, which is full of other creatures and obstacles that get in your way! Different creatures have different mechanical interactions that you can engage with.

- Leaves that crunch into a pit when stepped on
- Water which things can fall into and create walkable surfaces
- Naked snails that go into empty shells
